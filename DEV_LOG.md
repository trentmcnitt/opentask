### Activity/Undo/Toast Consistency Overhaul

**Problem:** Dashboard popover was firing immediate API calls when changing priority/recurrence, creating multiple undo entries and toasts for what felt like one user action. Activity items in history were truncated with no way to see full details.

**Solution:**

1. **Batched saves on dashboard** - QuickActionPanel now uses `onSaveAll` mode (same pattern as task detail page). All changes are staged locally and sent in a single PATCH call when Save is clicked. This means:
   - One API call instead of multiple
   - One undo entry instead of multiple
   - One descriptive toast (e.g., "Updated priority and recurrence")

2. **Enhanced `bulkEdit()` for snooze** - Discovered that `bulkEdit()` didn't handle `due_at` changes at all. Added snooze detection logic matching `updateTask()` so bulk edits now properly track `snooze_count`, `original_due_at`, and daily stats.

3. **Overdue tasks keep overdue status** - Previously, changing rrule on an overdue task would auto-compute a new due_at, making it magically not-overdue. Now: if task is overdue, changing recurrence only updates the schedule, not the due date. You still have to deal with the overdue task.

4. **Preview new due_at when changing recurrence** - When user changes recurrence in QuickActionPanel for a non-overdue task, the UI now shows a preview of what the new due_at will be (computed client-side using rrule library). Helps users understand the impact before saving.

5. **Expandable activity items** - History page now shows chevron on activity items. Click to expand and see full before/after details for each changed field. Collapsed view still truncates for clean list appearance.

**Files touched:**

- `src/app/page.tsx` - Added `handleSaveAllChanges`, wired batched save to popover
- `src/components/QuickActionPopover.tsx` - Added `onSaveAll` prop
- `src/components/QuickActionPanel.tsx` - Added `previewDueAt` computation and display
- `src/core/tasks/bulk.ts` - Added `due_at` handling with snooze detection, overdue check for rrule
- `src/core/tasks/update.ts` - Added overdue check in `applyAnchorUpdates()`
- `src/app/history/page.tsx` - Added expandable activity items with details panel
- `src/lib/format-toast.ts` - New file for `formatChangesToast()` helper

**Key insight:** The staged changes architecture already existed in QuickActionPanel - it was just a matter of wiring up the dashboard to use `onSaveAll` mode instead of individual callbacks. TaskDetail already worked this way.
