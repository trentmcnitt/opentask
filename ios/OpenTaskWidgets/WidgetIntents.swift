/// Every interaction the widgets support.
///
/// §8 platform facts these are built around:
///
/// - Interactive widgets are `AppIntent` buttons. On a locked device they are
///   inert until authentication, which is why the Lock Screen accessory
///   families below are glanceable-only and carry no buttons at all.
/// - Timeline reloads *triggered by a widget's own intent* are budget-free.
///   Every mutating intent below reloads the ACTING kind alone, both rounds
///   (2026-09-22, the macOS lag fix) — see `reloadOpenTaskWidget(kind:)`'s
///   doc for the invariant that makes this correct, not just fast.
/// - There are no swipe gestures in widgets, so paging between slots/projects
///   is done with explicit chevron intents rather than a gesture.
///
/// `isDiscoverable = false` throughout: these are widget plumbing, not things
/// a user should find in Shortcuts. Exposing "Move to next time slot" as a
/// user-facing shortcut would promise app state it does not have.

/// Reload ONE kind. The primary reload path for every intent below —
/// mutating and view-state alike (2026-09-22, the macOS lag fix).
///
/// It used to be that mutating intents reloaded all three kinds, on the
/// theory that "a completion changes counts on one widget and can change the
/// list on another." That theory is false for every mutation this file
/// performs. The three kinds partition the open-task set with NO overlap:
///
/// - Reminders ⊆ tasks where `is_reminder = true`
/// - Track ⊆ tasks where `isTracked` (`trackedFlag || progressTarget > 1`)
/// - Tasks ⊆ tasks where NEITHER of the above (`TasksTimeline`,
///   `.filter { !$0.isReminder && !$0.isTracked }`)
///
/// and reminder/tracked are mutually exclusive BY CONSTRUCTION, not by
/// convention: `refuseTrackedReminder` in `src/core/validation/task.ts`
/// rejects any create/update where both are true, with the comment "an item
/// is tracked or it is a reminder, never both." A task's membership in this
/// partition is also invariant under everything a widget button can do to
/// it — completing or logging progress never flips `is_reminder` or
/// `progress_target`. So completing a Reminders item can only change
/// Reminders; completing a Tasks item can only change Tasks (and there is no
/// Track call site for `CompleteTaskIntent` at all — grep confirms its only
/// two `Button(intent:)` sites are `RemindersWidgetViews.swift` and
/// `TasksWidgetViews.swift` — so "acting kind ∈ {Reminders, Tasks}" is
/// structural, not assumed); logging progress can only change Track. Reloading
/// the other two kinds was never keeping anything honest — it was queue
/// noise, and on macOS that noise was the whole latency bug (see
/// `reloadOpenTaskWidgets()` below for the measurement).

/// [io.mcnitt.opentask.mac.widgets]" logged for every kind but the one
/// currently executing. Budget-free (also confirmed: "overridden for budget

/// nothing can visibly change was pure contention against the one that
/// mattered.
///
/// Measured, in order, against real taps from Trent:
/// 1. Prior code (three kinds, unordered, both rounds): the PRE-network
///    reload of the tapped kind never won a queue slot before `perform()`
///    returned — first visible pixel 1.65s after the tap.
/// 2. Acting-kind-first, still three kinds both rounds: split, ~0.62s when
///    the queue was otherwise clear, ~1.66s when another reload of this
///    extension — this tap's own round-2 Reminders/Tasks passes, or a
///    scheduled refresh — was still draining ahead of it.
/// 3. This change (single kind, both rounds — pending live confirmation):
///    round 2 of any tap is now exactly one reload. A second `+1` landing
///    within that one pass's runtime (~535ms observed) still queues behind
///    it — that's the honest floor, one pass deep rather than two or three.
